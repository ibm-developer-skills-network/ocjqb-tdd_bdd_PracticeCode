# Lab 7: Practicing Test Driven Development (JavaScript/Node.js Version)

Welcome to the **Practicing Test Driven Development** lab. It is important to understand the workflow for practicing true test driven development by writing the test cases first to describe the behavior of the code, and then writing the code to make the tests pass, thus ensure that it has that behavior. In this lab we will do just that.

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

3. Run tests with coverage:
   ```bash
   npm run test:coverage
   ```

## Lab Structure

- **src/** - Source code
  - `counter.js` - Main Express.js application
  - `status.js` - HTTP status code constants

- **tests/** - Test files
  - `test_counter.test.js` - Jest test cases
