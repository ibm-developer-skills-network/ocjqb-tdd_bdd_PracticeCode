# Test Fixtures in JavaScript

Test fixtures are used to establish an initial known state before and after running tests. With test fixtures, we can describe what the test environment looks like before a test, or suite of tests, is run, and then again after the test runs.

## Lab Instructions

In this lab we are going to see the different ways in which test fixtures can be used to setup and teardown the initial state before and after testing in JavaScript.

You will do all of your editing work in the file `tests/account.test.js`. Open that up in the editor to get started.

### Lab Structure

The project includes the following files:

- `models/index.js` - Main database configuration
- `models/account.js` - Account model definition
- `utils/logger.js` - Simple logging utility
- `tests/account.test.js` - Test file you'll be working on
- `tests/fixtures/account_data.json` - Test data in JSON format

### Running Tests

To run the tests, use:

```bash
npm test
```
